String NumberandQuantity = 'A quantity is a measurable property of an object or a group of objects. It can be compared to other quantities, like being greater or lesser.

String Algebra = '''Algebra is a branch of math that uses numbers and letters (variables) to solve problems. It involves operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as symbols like =, ≠, <, >, ≤, and ≥. Equations, like x + 5 = 10, are common in algebra. It's like solving puzzles where we find values for variables. For example, in ⬜ + 10 = 13, the value of ⬜ (or x) is 3, making x + 10 = 13. Algebra helps us represent real-world situations mathematically, like expressing the cost of apples and guavas as x + 2y = 3 or the area of a rectangle as l × b = 36.''';
String Functions = '''function, in mathematics, an expression, rule, or law that defines a relationship between one variable (the independent variable) and another variable (the dependent variable). Functions are ubiquitous in mathematics and are essential for formulating physical relationships in the sciences. The modern definition of function was first given in 1837 by the German mathematician Peter Dirichlet:
If a variable y is so related to a variable x that whenever a numerical value is assigned to x, there is a rule according to which a unique value of y is determined, then y is said to be a function of the independent variable x.
This relationship is commonly symbolized as y = f(x)—which is said “f of x”—and y and x are related such that for every x, there is a unique value of y. That is, f(x) can not have more than one value for the same x. To use the language of set theory, a function relates an element x to an element f(x) in another set. The set of values of x is called the domain of the function, and the set of values of f(x) generated by the values in the domain is called the range of the function. In addition to f(x), other abbreviated symbols such as g(x) and P(x) are often used to represent functions of the independent variable x, especially when the nature of the function is unknown or unspecified.
Common functions
Many widely used mathematical formulas are expressions of known functions. For example, the formula for the area of a circle, A = πr2, gives the dependent variable A (the area) as a function of the independent variable r (the radius). Functions involving more than two variables (called multivariable or multivariate functions) also are common in mathematics, as can be seen in the formula for the area of a triangle, A = bh/2, which defines A as a function of both b (base) and h (height). In these examples, physical constraints force the independent variables to be positive numbers. When the independent variables are also allowed to take on negative values—thus, any real number—the functions are known as real-valued functions.
The formula for the area of a circle is an example of a polynomial function. The general form for such functions is
P(x) = a0 + a1x + a2x2+⋯+ anxn,
where the coefficients (a0, a1, a2,…, an) are given, x can be any real number, and all the powers of x are counting numbers (1, 2, 3,…). (When the powers of x can be any real number, the result is known as an algebraic function.) Polynomial functions have been studied since the earliest times because of their versatility—practically any relationship involving real numbers can be closely approximated by a polynomial function. Polynomial functions are characterized by the highest power of the independent variable. Special names are commonly used for such powers from one to five—linear, quadratic, cubic, quartic, and quintic for the highest powers being 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.
Polynomial functions may be given geometric representation by means of analytic geometry. The independent variable x is plotted along the x-axis (a horizontal line), and the dependent variable y is plotted along the y-axis (a vertical line). When the graph of a relation between x and y is plotted in the x-y plane, the relation is a function if a vertical line always passes through only one point of the graphed curve; that is, there would be only one point f(x) corresponding to each x, which is the definition of a function. The graph of the function then consists of the points with coordinates (x, y) where y = f(x). For example, the graph of the cubic equation f(x) = x3 − 3x + 2 is shown in the figure.
Another common type of function that has been studied since antiquity is the trigonometric functions, such as sin x and cos x, where x is the measure of an angle (see figure). Because of their periodic nature, trigonometric functions are often used to model behaviour that repeats, or “cycles.”''';
String modeling = '''A mathematical model is a way to describe real-world systems using math. It's used in various fields like science, engineering, and social sciences. Models help explain and predict behavior. They can be equations, rules, or assumptions that represent different parts of a system. There are different types of models:
Linear vs. Nonlinear: Linear models follow straightforward relationships, while nonlinear models involve more complex interactions. Nonlinear systems can lead to chaos and are often harder to study.
Static vs. Dynamic: Static models describe systems in balance, while dynamic models show changes over time. Dynamic models are usually represented by equations.
Explicit vs. Implicit: Explicit models have known inputs leading to calculated outputs. Implicit models involve solving for inputs based on known outputs, often through iterative methods.
Discrete vs. Continuous: Discrete models deal with distinct elements, while continuous models consider smooth changes, like fluid flow or temperature distribution.
Deterministic vs. Probabilistic (Stochastic): Deterministic models have fixed outcomes based on parameters, while stochastic models introduce randomness and deal with probability distributions.
Deductive, Inductive, or Floating: Deductive models come from theories, inductive ones from empirical data, and floating models lack strong theoretical or empirical basis.
Strategic vs. Non-Strategic: Strategic models, like those in game theory, involve decision-makers with conflicting interests, while non-strategic models assume rational choices for the best outcome.
Mathematical models help us understand and analyze complex systems, making predictions and guiding decisions in various fields.''';
String Geometry = '''Geometry is a branch of math that deals with the properties of space, like distance, shape, size, and position of shapes. It's one of the oldest areas of math and was mostly about concepts like points, lines, and angles until the 19th century. Geometry has wide applications in science, art, architecture, and more. It's also unexpectedly useful in areas like algebraic geometry, which helped solve Fermat's Last Theorem. In the 19th century, new discoveries expanded geometry, including non-Euclidean geometries used in general relativity. Since then, there are many subfields like differential geometry and algebraic geometry. This broadening of geometry's scope changed the meaning of "space" from just the physical world to a mathematical concept.''';
String StaticsandProbability = 'Statistics is the study of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It involves using techniques to understand patterns, make predictions, and draw conclusions from information. This is crucial in various fields, where we examine groups of people or objects, like all residents of a country or atoms in a crystal. Statistics has two key methods: descriptive (summarizing data using measures like average or variability) and inferential (making conclusions about broader populations based on sample data while considering uncertainty). It helps us make informed decisions even when dealing with uncertain information. This is used in scenarios like scientific research, industry, and social studies, where we study populations or processes, either by gathering data from everyone (census) or a subset (sample) to make meaningful predictions and estimates about the entire group.';
